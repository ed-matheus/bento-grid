# Frontend Mentor - Bento grid solution

![Design preview for the Bento grid coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [Bento grid challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bento-grid-RMydElrlOj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects, I always learn doing those projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap classes

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
